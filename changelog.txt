- fixed bug where \left and \right keyboard shortcuts would add a trailing space which needed to be deleted every time.
- changed Ctrl+Shift+T to \text{} instead of the far-less used \texttt{}.
- added shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+B inserts \big
- added some sensible defaults to BUILD.sh, so you don't have to go figure out where to put things.
